Taby,

So I told you about some things I need you to do for the website, but I added a few more. I'm sorry this is taking so much of your time and energy.
I thought I would be able to do all this for you. 
It turns out, I'm in way over my head with just puting something up that will work and look amazing.
All of these things will help your SEO. You'll get better rankings in Google Search and more interaction from visitors 
if we can nail down what they want and get the right elements on the page.
The cool thing is, we're working on a site for Hruska's Kolaches in our class, which will teach me a lot of the things I'll need to build your site.

1 Sign up for Bluehost.	
2 choose payment method for shopping on your site. For now I plan on using shopsite because Bluehost lets you use it free.
	But do you want customers to check out using PayPal? braintree? Stripe? Something else? 
	Some are designed for people using your site on their phone - braintree and stripe. Some may not be. 
	I was trying to figure that out, but it was taking too long. 
3 Get photos together that you want on the site
4 write whatever is interesting and useful about Taby Bags: story, location, team, why buy, shoppers' experiences, events, store news, fashion news, etc. 
	We need 300 words on the home page, and 300 words on any other page.
5 Tell me about your market. 
	What were the last 30 customers like, or most customers like? Age? Income level? Interests? Where do they live? etc. 
	What do they like about your store? 
	What don't they like? 
	Why do they shop there? Location? Price? Lifestyle/tradition? Customer Service? Specialty items? ect.
	What kind of look and feel do they expect in the store? Which of those elements need to be in the webpage?	
6 make a list of keywords that you think people will use to search for Taby Bags.
