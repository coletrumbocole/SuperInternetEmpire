		<h1>The Accomplisher 5000</h1>
		<h2>It aims for easiness in tracking time, tracking to do's, and communicating with people who help.</h2>
	<body> I want to make an app that takes 5 mins to account for time, prioritize life's demands, make goals, set up a plan, and collaborate with others. Hopefully it will help people like us move through projects and know what each person is accomplishing. There are two things we need to quantify:<h6> What did I spend my time doing? What did I accomplish? </h6><br></br>

			<h2>Features</h2>
			The only thing I am really sure about is that it will open up to a main screen where you keep track of what you have done with your time that day. Then you will see the items that need to be done the next day, and you will be able to add more. Then you can share the next day's plans with other people with the app. The other people who are working with you on a project will be able to see what you have done that day and your plans for the next day.
		</p>
		<p>I also want to mention these ideas, but they aren't so necessary to begin with. On one screen you could be asked questions about your priorities, challenges, and goals. I think these should come up as buttons, and you say yes or no to them by swiping them left or right. Then you would be taken back to the things that need to be done the next day and you will know what items to change or add. Or there could be a goal generator tool that tells you how much to do in a day to accomplish a big goal by a certain time.
